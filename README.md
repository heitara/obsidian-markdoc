Very basic syntax highlighting for markdoc blocks is provided by this plugin.

## How to use

If you would like to manually install this plugin you need to download three different files:
- manifest.json
- main.js
- styles.css

Inside your vault locate the `.obsidian` directory. Create `plugins` folder and create a new subdirectory (could be called `mdoc`). Copy the three aforementioned files inside the newly created subdirectory. Lastly, reload the obsidian app and in settings under the "Community plugins" enable this plugin.

After finishing these steps the plugin should be installed.
